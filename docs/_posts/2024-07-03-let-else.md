Stable since [November 3, 2022](https://releases.rs/docs/1.65.0/), Rust's [`let-else`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/let_else.html) is a bit of an odd one ([RFC](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3137-let-else.html)).

As defined by the linked `Rust by Example` docs above:
> With let-else, a refutable pattern can match and bind variables in the surrounding scope like a normal let, or else diverge (e.g. break, return, panic!) when the pattern doesn't match.

The RFC doc more formally defines it as:

```
let PATTERN: TYPE = EXPRESSION else DIVERGING_BLOCK;
```

and notes that this is the _the counterpart of if-let expressions_ which we covered in a previous post.

Essentially, we are attempting to bind some expression to some type and if this is "non-bindable", then execute the diverging block.

In generalized DTR, we'd get something like this:

```
{ instruction: evaluate, input: (SOME_EXPRESSION), assign: SOME_EXPRESSION_RESULT, scope: 0 }
{ instruction: evaluate, input: (try_assign, SOME_EXPRESSION_RESULT, SOME_TYPE), assign: SUCCESSFUL_ASSIGN_RESULT, scope: 0 }
{ instruction: jump, input: (SUCCESSFUL_ASSIGN_RESULT, 1), scope: 0 }
{ instruction: jump, input: (2), scope: 0 }
{ instruction: jump, input: (0), scope: 1 } // effectively "jump" over the diverging block
*** DIVERGING BLOCK at scope 2 ***
{ instruction: jump, input: (0), scope: 2 }
```

### Specific Example

For a specific example, consider the following rust code:
```rust
fn get_count_item(s: &str) {
    let Ok(foobar) = ok_foobar else {
        panic!("Can't parse ok foobar");
    };
}
```

We can then translate this to DTR leveraging the notion of a `try_assign` from the `if-let` post.

```
// [0] let Ok(foobar) = ok_foobar
{ instruction: evaluate, input: (try_assign, Ok(foobar), ok_foobar), assign: SUCCESSFUL_ASSIGN_RESULT, scope: 0 }
// [0] if let ..., scope = 1
{ instruction: jump, input: (SUCCESSFUL_ASSIGN_RESULT, 1), scope: 0 }
// [0] else, scope = 2
{ instruction: jump, input: (2), scope: 0 }
// [1] scope = 0
{ instruction: jump, input: (0), scope: 1 }
// [2] panic!("Can't parse ok foobar");
{ instruction: exit_with_message, input: ("\"Can't parse ok foobar\""), scope: 2}
```

**Note:** here we don't have to "jump back to scope 0" since `exit_with_message` is a terminal instruction.
